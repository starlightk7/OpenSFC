# Introduction

Welcome to OpenSFC!

This is an Open Source Hardware (OSHW) project aimed at creating 1:1 reproduction part for SFC / SNES consoles for use in repair and customization. In addition, parts will be documented, schematics drawn, and replacements for obsolete parts identified where possible.

# Why Would I Want This?

There are many reasons why you might want an OpenSFC part

* Repairing Damage to Original Boards
  * Boards can be damaged by a variety of incidents
    * Leaked Capacitors
    * Liquid Spills
    * Flooded basements/warehouses
    * Humidty damage from improper storage
    * Failed mod attempts
  * These parts can serve as replacement parts to repair the unit.
* Learning
  * You may want to learn about how our beloved console works
  * The ability to build one by hand is an excellent way to gain some insight into how the console works
* Customization
  * Some people find joy in customizing a beat-up unit while restoring it, and OSHW parts are great for that. 
  * Please be responsible and choose a rustic unit for your restoration so that we don't needlessly deplete the supply of original units in good condition
* Integrating fixes/mods
  * The reference board is a 1:1 reproduction, but you may want to customize it.
  * You may want to remix a custom board that integrates mods or fixes of your choice into the board.
  * Anyone can create a derivative under the terms of the [CERN-OHL-S](https://ohwr.org/cern_ohl_s_v2.txt) license.
