# FAQ

**Q:** Will you be doing boards for other models?

**A:** I intend to eventually reproduce all NTSC variants, however this will take quite some time. I can make no guarantees on the timing of release. In the meantime, the best routed 2-CHIP SFC board is the SHVC which is already reproduced. These have the least amount of quality problems. For PAL consoles, please google the nonSNES project. I am currently in need of SNS-1CHIP-01 and SNS-1CHIP-03. I also need a US variant of an RGB/APU/1-CHIP in order to look at the late model controller input board. If you wish to sell or donate one of these units for R&D, please contact me.

**Q:** Can I build a SNES instead of an SFC?

**A:** Yes, as long as you buy the correct front panel and get a SNES rear power panel, either from a donor or one of the aftermarket parts. However, if your donor is a Super Famicom, none of the aftermarket kits current include the springs required for the shell, and the ones from the Super Famicom are NOT compatible. I working on identifying aftermarket replacements, but in the meantime, if you want to build a SNES, your donor should also be one to use these springs.

**Q:** Why is red significantly more expensive?

**A:** The fabs charge a substantial premium for red, and this premium is amplified x3 because of there being 3 boards. Unfortunately even with a volume purchase there's no way to avoid the price needing to be higher ðŸ˜”

**Q:** Can I commission you for a pre-built?

**A:** In general I will not have time to do this on an ongoing basis, however, I may irregularly list pre-builts on the Ko-Fi store of units that were used for build validation. Once these are gone, they're generally gone unless there is development need to build another. [1upRestorations](https://1uprestorations.com) will provide a [custom build service](https://1uprestorations.com/collections/pre-modded-consoles/products/opensfc-custom-build) if you wish to commission a pre-built.

**Q:** Can I use **&lt;insert mod x&gt;**?

**A:** Any mod that is compatible with the original SHVC should be compatible with OpenSFC. However, if you have modified the BOM, or done other community recommended fixes, keep in mind that deviation from the stock part configuration may adversely effect mods, especially in the case of edge mods.

**Q:** Why didn't you integrate **&lt;insert common community bodge fix&gt;**?

**A:** I am first and foremost most interested in historical preservation, which means preserving the stock design. While I am open to making revised versions in the future, not all of these fixes and mods are compatible with each other. I want to study the issues in detail before investing in any enhanced boards. I cannot promise I will make any such boards in the future, but there is nothing stopping someone else from doing so either. You may also freely apply these fixes yourself in the same way as stock, or remix the board to include them and order a copy for yourself.
