# Requirements

## Skills

The following skills are required to successfully complete this project

* Soldering Skills
  * Must be able to solder through hole components
  * Must be able to solder 0805 size SMD passives
  * Must be able to solder fine pitch QFP chips

* Desoldering skills
  * Must be able to desolder through hole components
  * Must be able to desolder QFP chips without damaging them

* Multimeter
  * Must understand basic use of a multimeter and how to test continuity and voltage

## Tools

The following tools are required to successfully complete this project

* Minimum
  * Soldering iron
  * Solder
    * Leaded 63/37
    * Low Melt Solder (strongly recommended)
  * Flux
  * Desoldering wick
  * Desoldering Gun or Pump (Strongly Recommneded)
  * 99% Isopropyl Alcohol
  * Q-Tips/Toothbrush for Cleaning
  * Multi-meter

* Recommended
  * SNES Burn In Cart, or ROM on a Flash Cart
    * Access to this highly recommended. If you don't know if the chips in your system work properly to begin with you will have a hard time debugging if it is your first build.
    * If using SD2SNES, turn off all in-game hooks and save states or it can cause errors on the tests, particularly with the timing tests.
  * Temperature controlled soldering iron
    * J-Tip for QFP Soldering / Desoldering
    * Spatula Tip (optional, but makes pre-tinning much easier)
  * Solder
    * Kester 63/37 w/ Rosin Core (any reputable brand is fine)
    * ChipQuik Low Melt Solder
  * Goot Wick Desoldering Braid
    * This stuff is the best braid I've ever used. Great for cleaning the chip legs.
  * Tacky Flux such as ChipQuik SMD291 (any brand is fine)
  * FR-301 Desoldering Gun or Equivalent
    * 1.6mm Tip for Controller Ports
    * 0.8mm Tip for Connectors
  * Kapton Tape
    * Protect the beautiful ENIG plane
  * Anti-static wristband
    * Failure to use one may cause ESD damage to parts. This is not always instant; a zap may cause damage that may make it fail at a delay.
  * Safety glasses
    * Please wear them. The time you don't have them can be the time you really needed them
  * Fume extractor
    * Prolonged fumes are bad for you health. If you do not have an extractor at least work near and open window and blow a fan toward it if you can.

* Optional
  * Some people may want Hot Air Station or Hot Plate, but these are not strictly necessary. If you don't have one you do need a J-Tip and ChipQuik Low melt. I recommend low melt solder regardless and keeping your station temperature lower to avoid damaging the chips.
