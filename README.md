# OpenSFC

## Note: This is a placeholder. OpenSFC will see it's first public release on October 10th, 2025.

## Introduction

This repository contains OSHW Reproduction Parts related to the Super Famicom (SFC) / Super NES (SNES) game console under the umbrella name OpenSFC. While the parts are primarily developed form the Super Famicom models, you can build a North American SNES as well as long as you use the appropriate front and rear panels. See the documentation for details.

These parts are freely available under the CERN-OHL-S license for you to use, study, modify, or sell under the terms of the CERN-OHL-S repository. The source files are provided as-is with no warranty or entitlement for support to you or any users that you sell manufactured boards to. See LICENSE for details.

***If you produce these boards for sale, you are responsible for all customer support related to the product as well as your compliance with the license***. If you have any questions about this, feel free to contact with questions. If you are an end user who purchased a board from a store, contact your distributor for any support inquiries. If you are interested in becoming an authorized distributor for your region, please contact me via Discord or Twitter.

This ultimate goal of this project is to eventually document and reproduce all models, but it will take some time. In the meantime, I made the best overall parts (in my opinion) first. If you believe in that goal, consider donating or subscribing on Ko-Fi; labor aside, donor boards to research, prototypes, and parts are all expensive.

## Usage

Suggested usage for the documents and boards in this repository:
* Studying the hardware and learning abouut it's function
* Aiding repairs and failure diagnostics through the created schematics
* Repairing broken consoles via replacement, reproduction parts
* Building a customized console as a project, for educational purposes.

## Disclaimer

**WARNING:** Doing a full build is an advanced project. Please carefully read the documentation and required skills and experience before purchasing or ordering a board. Purchasing boards and parts does not guarantee that you can be successful in doing a build. Significant experience in soldering and desoldering, along with a variety of tools are necessary. Your first build will likely not work on its first boot. Patience, analysis, and debugging will likely be necessary to bring the unit online. Order at your own risk. The author provides no guarantee of your success, and also cannot guarantee that any given vendor can fabricate these boards correctly. If you are ordering boards, please consult with your target vendor before ordering if you wish to order a board.

If you simply wish to buy a produced board, please consider buying from an authorized distributor from the parts index below. Stock is currently available in the US, UK, and Japan. Authorized distributors help fund the development of these boards by donating funds back to this project. As such, boards purchased from an authorized distributor will receive limited customer support. Support will be offered in helping you debug a build, check for shorts, broken joints, etc. However, support cannot realistically guarantee you a successful build. In the end, success will depend on your skills, and may fail even with support if you physically damage the boards or parts.
